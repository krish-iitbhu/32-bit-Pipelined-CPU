# 32-bit-Pipelined-CPU
5-Stage Pipelined MIPS32 Processor
Built using Verilog | RTL-based CPU Design | NPTEL Guided Project

Overview
This project is a custom-designed 32-bit 5-stage pipelined MIPS32 processor, developed as part of the NPTEL course Hardware Modeling using Verilog by Prof. Indranil Sengupta. It supports MIPS-style instructions and handles various pipeline hazards using efficient architectural techniques.

The processor simulates instruction execution through five stages:
IF → ID → EX → MEM → WB, with custom hazard resolution mechanisms for data, control, and structural hazards.

Instruction Format
The MIPS32 instruction set architecture supports three types of instructions:

Instruction Formats

R-type: Used for register-to-register ALU operations
I-type: Used for immediate operations, memory access, and branches
J-type: Used for jump instructions (not included in this processor)
Key Features
Fully functional 32-bit pipelined CPU in Verilog
Supports 14 custom MIPS-style instructions (R-type, I-type, load/store, branch, halt)
Efficient handling of data, control, and structural hazards
Branch resolution using early condition check and pipeline flushing
Memory and instruction storage using separate modules
Two-phase clocking system to separate pipeline stages
Architecture and Data Flow
The processor follows the classic 5-stage pipeline and manages instruction/control flow through a datapath consisting of the following elements:

Processor Datapath

Pipelined Stages
IF (Instruction Fetch)
Fetches instruction from memory and calculates next PC.

ID (Instruction Decode & Register Fetch)
Decodes opcode, reads registers, and performs sign extension for immediate values.

EX (Execution/Address Calculation)
Executes ALU operations or computes branch target addresses.

MEM (Memory Access)
Loads data from memory or writes to memory.

WB (Write Back)
Writes result back to register file.

Clock Cycle Execution
The pipelined design allows multiple instructions to be in different stages of execution simultaneously. Below is a visual representation:

Pipeline Clock Cycle

Each instruction progresses one stage per clock cycle, and the pipeline is kept busy with new instructions entering every cycle.

Hazard Handling
Data Hazards
Managed using two-phase clocking and controlled stalling. This ensures that operands are ready before being used in the ALU or memory stages.

Control Hazards
Handled by evaluating branch conditions in the EX stage. If a branch is taken, the IF and ID stages are flushed, resulting in minimal penalty.

Structural Hazards
Eliminated by using separate instruction and data memories, and a two-read, one-write register file.

Design Decisions
Inter-stage pipeline registers (e.g., IF_ID_IR, ID_EX_A) store intermediate values and control signals.
Memory is modeled as a 1KB array (Mem[1023:0]).
Register file consists of 32 general-purpose registers (Reg[31:0]).
Custom TYPE control values distinguish instruction categories in pipeline stages.

How to Run
Load the Verilog source code into a simulator (e.g., Vivado, ModelSim).
Initialize Mem with encoded instruction binaries.
Use alternating clock signals (clk1 and clk2) to simulate pipelined flow.
Observe pipeline register contents (IF_ID_IR, ID_EX_A, etc.) and register values.
Validate memory outputs and register file for correctness
